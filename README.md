# **XChange: Hyperlocal Barter & Trade Marketplace**

## Project Overview
XChange is a web-based platform designed to facilitate hyperlocal, non-monetary transactions through bartering. It connects people within communities to trade items and services without using money, promoting sustainability, reducing waste, and fostering local connections. Users can list items or services theyâ€™re willing to offer and browse others' listings to propose trades.

## Core Features
âœ… User Authentication â€“ Sign up, log in, and manage profiles securely.
âœ… Dashboard â€“ View active barter listings and personalized recommendations.
âœ… Create Listings â€“ Users can list items or services they want to barter, with images and descriptions.
âœ… Trade Requests â€“ Users can propose and negotiate trades directly with others.
âœ… Chat System â€“ Built-in chat for discussing barter terms and agreements.
âœ… Categories & Filters â€“ Easy browsing by category (items, services, etc.) and location-based filtering.
âœ… Rating & Review System â€“ Users rate completed trades to build trust within the community.
âœ… Wishlist â€“ Users can mark items theyâ€™re looking for, allowing others to propose matching trades.
